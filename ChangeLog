	* Created 2.0 branch.

2011-11-07  David Bigagli  <david@openlava.net>

	* lib.host.c Rewrote the caching code to read the hosts file only
	once and add the host in the cache. Removed the cache timeout
	and simplified the entire implementation to use only two interface
	functions: Gethostbyname_() and Gethostbyaddr_().
	Change the old C types u_int and casta to char *
	into the current linux types whenever required.
	Modified the daemons code to use the new host library
	implementation.

2011-10-30  David Bigagli  <david@openlava.net>

	* mbd.policy.c Developed a little round robin scheduler absed on the number of jobs a user has running.

	* openlava.spec  modified the spec file so that autoconf creates
	openlava configuration files and use the outptu variables to make
	the necessary subsititution in the them. Change the post install
	to just erase the package without saving anything.
	Removed the symbolic link as that is something sites have to
	do as they may want to run more versions together, also
	in now the lsf.conf has the version in the openlava
	fundamental variables clearly indicating which version is in use.

2011-09-16  David Bigagli  <david@openlava.net>

2011-09-09  David Bigagli  <david@openlava.net>

	* openlava.spec Updated the spec file to reflect the changes in teh build system. The ownership of all files changed, no longer root, the entire installation tree is owned by the openlava user. The daemons to run in multi user mode must still be started at root which is guaranteed at boot by init.

2011-08-27  David Bigagli  <david@openlava.net>

	* openlavaconfig.h Removed it from the top directory and merge its content into lsf.h which is the openlava master header file. In this way the repository is more GNU like as well.

	CPUs as provided by openlava base.
